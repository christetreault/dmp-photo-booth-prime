DMP Photobooth
===============

DMP Photobooth is a photobooth application.

This repository is a re-implementation of the program in Haskell. The original version, which can be found at https://github.com/christetreault/dmp-photo-booth-legacy, was implemented in C. The C version is no longer being developed.

The current version is a work in progress. As this version reaches completion, it will become version 2.0, and will supercede the original.
